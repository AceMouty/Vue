# Data Binding

## using vue directives bind urls and html to the DOM.

- create an **input** and use **v-bind** to bind data to the value attribute of the tag
- create an "a" tag and bind a url from the vue instance to the tags href
- create a "p" tage and inject html into the tag with v-html

All of the data that is bound should come from the data property in the Vue instance
